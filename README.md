## About
Cinetag is a website to watch and store your favorite movies!
All movies we got on our website come from youtube, they are attach, so we don't host anyone movie.

## Concept
The figma was made by Alura, a school of courses, inspired by the most famous streaming websites, so we got a page to see the catalogue and you can save on favorites.
